# wxStudioide
A Rapid Application Development IDE for wxWidgets for Python, C++, XRC. Written in Python3

The aim of this project is to create an IDE for wxWidgets wxPython and XRC file generator that ia more like VisualStudio or Delphi making the development process much easier and quicker. The idea is to provide the most comprehensive collection of widgets and access to all of the various classes of wxWidgets/wxPython as well as to widgetize popular libraries for things like sockets, graphics, sound, web, etc by writing wrappers for the libraries that will allow them to easily be used and integrated into the IDE.

Currently all that I have is a wxFormBuilder project file which can be used to generate the python coded for the IDE's current state in development. Currently I have a fair amount of the UI fo the IDE sort of in place and am working on slowly flushing out all of the necessary dialogs and menu Items and such. I have gone through the wxFormBuilder project and more or less sanitized all of the object names so everything was easy to read and identify. 

The current state is not in a finished working state, so all it is at the moment is the IDE UI without functionality. I could use any help that anyone would want to pitch in to helping me getting this project up and functional and eventually finished. 

I am working on writing drafts for the specifications of the plugin system, the widgets system, the various project files and such and should have them uploaded soon as well.
